# SierraWhiskeyEcho

### What's with the name?

Just using the good ol' phonetic alphabet along with the abbreviation of Software Engineer. 

### Task and Purpose?

Deliver a clear and concise guide of resources available to Veterans that they can leverage to help start a new career, hobby, or passion with no paywalls.

Provide a place for Vets to reach out to those who've gone down a similar path, no one gets left behind.

### Is this just for vets trying to break into Software Engineering?

Nope! The information compiled here can be applied to just about any career in tech.

### Why?

Having to switch careers is stressful. Add in juggling family obligations, coping with your service connected disabilities, life in general, and it can be real easy to start to lose hope. Let me be the first to say, 

**you are not alone**.

### What can I expect from SierraWhiskeyEcho in the future?
- [x] Create the repo
- [ ] GitHub Pages static site with resources, links, blogs
- [ ] Make a Discord
- [ ] Set up *free* courses from volunteers (who are vets) over Discord/Zoom
- [ ] Guides on how to set up development environments on Windows/Mac/Linux
- [ ] Better documentation
- [ ] t-shirts? stickers? patches? coffee mugs?!


### Again, you are not alone, you matter
